<!-- Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

  .forEach in and of itself does not create a new array, but .map does create a new array, leaving the old one alone.

What is the difference between a function and a method?

They both are functions, the difference is that a method is a function inside of an object.

What is closure?

closure is the ability for objects, functions, and arrays that are nested inside a parent function to recieve attributes from the parent function despite being outside of their scope.

Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

In window binding, if the 'this' doesn't have any specified thing it is bound to, then it is bound to the window or console object.
In implicit binding, 'this' refers to the object to the left of the dot whenever a function is called.
In new binding, 'this' refers to the object that is created with the constructor.
In explicit binding, 'this' is clearly defined in the parentheses after .call, .apply, or .bind.

Why do we need super() in an extended class? 

Super() is part of the syntax and is 'paired' with extends in order to make the class work. The two work together to replace prototype and object.create()--super() being the part that replaces object.create().
